## Forward Proxy 

As part of the project, I successfully implemented a forward proxy solution using Squid on an Ubuntu EC2 instance within a private subnet. The proxy server was configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic from a Windows EC2 instance that lacked direct internet access. I adjusted the Squid configuration to permit traffic from the Windows subnet (`10.200.123.128/28`), exposed the necessary port (3128) via security group rules, and pointed the Windows EC2's proxy settings to the Ubuntu proxyâ€™s private IP.
