## Week 1 Journal 

## 9 June 2025

I draw and documented a private media streaming setup where House B streams from a Jellyfin server in House A. 

✅ What's done:

Created a full network diagram using Excalidraw (ran out of Lucidchart diagrams 😅)

Wrote a README explaining the data flow

Added a 🎥 video walkthrough placeholder — I’ll record it using Descript, still pending

🐢 Bootcamp-wise: My main challenge was that I started a week late due to my trip to Malaysia, but I followed the livestreams remotely and caught up.
As a bonus, I dropped in a turtle pic from the trip! 🐢📸🌴
