# HA Proxy 

An **HAProxy** (High Availability Proxy) is a powerful open-source tool commonly used as a **load balancer** and **reverse proxy**. It distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and improved performance of applications.

In the tutorial, the goal was to set up an Ubuntu EC2 instance as an HAProxy server. However, some necessary configuration files were mentioned but not actually provided, which prevented a full hands-on setup.

In AWS, a similar function is typically handled by the **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** service, which offers managed load balancing across EC2 instances, containers, and IPs. ELB provides HAProxy-like functionality but with integrated scaling, monitoring, and availability features managed by AWS.
