# Linux Networking 

### ‚úÖ Linux Networking: Verifying EC2-to-EC2 Communication

In this setup, we deployed two EC2 instances ‚Äî one running **Ubuntu** and the other **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** ‚Äî within the same VPC and subnet. Each instance has two network interfaces (enX0 and enX1) with unique private IP addresses.

We aimed to **verify bidirectional communication** between the instances using their private IPs.

1. **From Ubuntu**, we used `ping` to send ICMP packets to Red Hat‚Äôs secondary interface at `10.200.123.137`.
2. **On Red Hat**, we installed `tcpdump` and used it to capture ICMP traffic on `enX1`. The tool confirmed that echo requests and replies were being exchanged ‚Äî proving network connectivity.
3. We also performed the **reverse ping from Ubuntu to Red Hat‚Äôs primary IP (10.200.123.9)** and confirmed responses.

This validates that both interfaces can communicate over the internal network, which is essential for simulating more complex multi-interface architectures or testing firewall rules and routing configurations.

#### Code Samples: Ubuntu ‚Üí RedHat Ping Test

From Ubuntu (`10.200.123.6`), ping RedHat's secondary interface (`10.200.123.137`):

```sh
ping 10.200.123.137
```

```
64 bytes from 10.200.123.137: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2.05 ms
...
15 packets transmitted, 15 received, 0% packet loss
```

### üîç tcpdump on RedHat

On RedHat, after installing tcpdump:

```sh
sudo yum install tcpdump
sudo tcpdump -i enX1 icmp
```

Captured traffic:

```
ICMP echo request, id 1126, seq 1
ICMP echo reply, id 1126, seq 1
...
```

### üéØ Result

* Ping confirms Ubuntu can reach RedHat on both interfaces.
* Tcpdump confirms ICMP packets arrive and are replied to.
* Networking setup works as expected in your VPC.

## üì° `wget` vs `curl` ‚Äì Key Differences

* **`curl -I`** is ideal for inspecting HTTP **headers only** and does **not follow redirects** by default (`-L` to enable).
* **`wget`** downloads the **entire file content** and **follows redirects** automatically.

Use `curl` for lightweight checks (e.g. API response headers) and `wget` for downloading full resources.


`curl` example:

```sh
ubuntu@ip-10-200-123-6:~$ curl -I https://aws.amazon.com/
